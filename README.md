# SYDE-252

#### a1q1.m - Problem 1: Numeric approximate of continuous-time convolution
#### a1q3.m - Problem 3: Numeric approximation of Fourier transform of continuoustime signals

#### a1q4-Built-In-FT.m is Problem 4: Identification of piano keys
##### This solution uses MATLAB's built in fft() function to perform Fourier Transforms

#### a1q4-Custom-FT.m is Problem 4: Identification of piano keys
##### This solution uses our custom MyFT function (from a1q3.m) to perform Fourier Transforms
